      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Tanish — someone who’s always been driven by curiosity and the power of action. I’m currently part of the Masters' Union Cohort 28, pursuing Chartered Accountancy alongside, driven by my love for finance and numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve worn many hats: from winning prestigious finance competitions at IIT Bombay and IIM Ranchi, to building “Acilert” — an alert system designed to detect accidents and save lives. I've co-founded a luxury cab startup, "Paalki", and recently started working on a sleeping pod booking platform called "Snoozed In".
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it’s pitching at college fests, strategizing for cricket matches, or crafting a sustainable Instagram channel — I love creating and leading. My story is about learning, building, failing fast, and rising stronger. And this is just the beginning.
      </p>
